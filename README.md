1. Create a QR Code with python Programming where we need to install modules through pip:-
 1.1 pip install pyqrcode 
 1.2 pip install svglib for SVG file.
2. Scan the QR Code with Android Phone which send data from Android Client to Python Server using socket programming.
3. Create a socket program on python to receive data from android client and store it in an Object.
4. Connect Python program with Mysql database and store that data in a object.
5. Now we will compare both objects and validates the data and send back the response to client where the response will displayed on Android display.
